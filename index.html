                    Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
                    and a
                    simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
                    typing,
                    together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
                    development in many areas on most platforms.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form
                    for
                    all major platforms from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Web site</a> and may be freely
                    distributed. The
                    same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs
                    and
                    tools, and additional documentation.

                <p>
                    The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or
                    other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable
                    applications.

                    If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For
                    example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and
                    rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom
                    database,
                    or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but
                    find
                    the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such
                    a
                    library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could
                    use
                    an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your
                    application.

                <p>
                    In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>>
                    and
                    …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines
                    that do
                    not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by
                    itself in
                    an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments.
                    Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A
                    comment
                    may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A
                    hash
                    character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are
                    not
                    interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
                </p>

                    We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        >>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
                        ...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
                        ...     a, b = 0, 1
                        ...     while a &lt; n:
                        ...         print(a, end=' ')
                        ...         a, b = b, a+b
                        ...     print()
                        ...
                        >>> # Now call the function we just defined:
                        ... fib(2000)
                        0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597

                <p>
                    The keyword def introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the function name and the
                    parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the
                    next
                    line, and must be indented.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the
                    function’s documentation string, or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section
                    Documentation Strings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed
                    documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include
                    docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.

                <p>
                    The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function.
                    More
                    precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas
                    variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing
                    functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global
                    variables and variables of enclosing functions cannot be directly assigned a value within a function
                    (unless, for global variables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing functions,
                    named
                    in a nonlocal statement), although they may be referenced.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the
                    called
                    function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an
                    object reference, not the value of the object). 1 When a function calls another function, a new local
                    symbol
                    table is created for that call.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the
                    function
                    name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function. This value can be
                    assigned
                    to another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        >>> fib
                        &lt;function fib at 10042ed0&gt;
                        >>> f = fib
                        >>> f(100)
                        0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
                    </pre>
                </code>
    
                <p>
                    Coming from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it
                    doesn’t
                    return a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather
                    boring one. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally
                    suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want
                    to using print():
                </p>
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        >>> fib(0)
                        >>> print(fib(0))
                        None
                    </pre>
                </code>
    
                <p>
                    It is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of
                    printing it:
                </p>
    
                <code>
                    <pre>
                        >>> def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n
                        ...     """Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n."""
                        ...     result = []
                        ...     a, b = 0, 1
                        ...     while a &lt; n:
                        ...         result.append(a)    # see below
                        ...         a, b = b, a+b
                        ...     return result
                        ...
                        >>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it
                        >>> f100                # write the result
                        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
                    </pre>
                </code>
    
                <p>
                    This example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:
                </p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument
                        returns
                        None. Falling off the end of a function also returns None.
                    </li>
    
                    <li>
                        The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function that
                        ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an
                        expression), and methodname is the name of a method that is defined by the object’s type. Different
                        types define different methods. Methods of different types may have the same name without causing
                        ambiguity. (It is possible to define your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes)
                        The
                        method append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it adds a new element at the end
                        of
                        the list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but more efficient.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    It is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms,
                    which can be combined.
                </p>
                <h3>Default Argument Values</h3>
                <p>
                    The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function
                    that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow. For example:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        giving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        or even giving all arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')
                    </li>
